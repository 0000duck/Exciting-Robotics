(1): Bold and Italic

	Use **contents here** to make a piece bold

	Use _contents here_ to make a piece italic

	If both, put asterisks outside just to make it more legible **_contents here_**

(2): Headers

	Preface the phrase with a hash mark (#)
	
	Place the same number of hash marks as the size of the header you want:

		For a header one (largest), put one hash mark

		For a header two (second largest), put two hash marks
	
(3): Links
	
	1. **_Inline_** link:
	
		To created an inline link, you wrap the link text in brackets([ ]), and then you wrap the link in parenthesis( ( ) ). For example: [Visit GitHub!](www.github.com).

	2. **_Reference_** link

		The link is actually a reference to another link in the document.
